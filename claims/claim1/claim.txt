Claim 1: Basic Functionality and Communication Protocol Prediction
================================================================

This claim demonstrates that ProtoReveal can successfully:
1. Load and analyze firmware binaries
2. Detect peripheral memory accesses within specified address ranges
3. Predict communication protocols used by firmware
4. Generate structured output data (CSV files)
5. Complete analysis without crashing

The experiment uses representative firmware samples to validate:
- NUC230240/NUC240_ADC_Median_Filter.bin for analysis command
- LoadFuncToSRAM.bin for test command
- Peripheral access pattern detection
- Communication protocol prediction
- Feature extraction and data generation
- End-to-end tool functionality

Expected outcome: Successful analysis with generated CSV files containing peripheral access data, communication protocol predictions, and feature matrices.
