# Infrastructure Constraints and Access

## No Private Infrastructure Required

ProtoReveal is designed to run on **public research infrastructure only**. No special hardware, private servers, or restricted access is required.

## Public Infrastructure Sufficient

The tool runs successfully on:
-  **Docker Compose** (tested - works on any system with Docker installed)
-  **Native Installation (Linux)** (tested - requires Linux with apt-get)
-  **Cross-Platform Installation** (tested - works on Mac, Linux, Windows)



## No Special Hardware

-  **GPU not required** - CPU-only analysis
-  **Special peripherals not required** - analyzes firmware files
-  **Hardware-in-the-loop not required** - static analysis only
-  **Proprietary tools not required** - open source dependencies only

## Access Instructions

### For Reviewers
1. **Recommended**: Use Docker Compose (works on any system)
2. **Alternative**: Use Native Installation on Linux systems
3. **Alternative**: Use Cross-Platform Installation on Mac/Windows/Linux


### Model Access
- **ML models** hosted on Google Drive (public links)
- **No authentication required** for model download
- **Automatic download** via provided script

## Troubleshooting
- If public infrastructure fails, contact authors via HotCRP
- All dependencies are open source and freely available
- No proprietary or restricted components
